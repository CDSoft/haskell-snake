# Snake puzzle in Haskell

Once I have been offered a snake puzzle.
It's made of 64 cubes of wood, some of them can turn.
The goal is to fold this snake into a 4x4x4 cube.

After a while trying to solve this cube I decided to write a solver in Prolog.
I present here an Haskell version of this solver.

So here is my own version...

- the source code in Literate Haskell: [snake.lhs](snake.lhs)
- the document rendered in Markdown: [snake.md](snake.md)
